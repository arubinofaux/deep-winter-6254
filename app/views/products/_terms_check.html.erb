Action Mailer now handles the auto encoding of multibyte characters inside of headers and bodies.

If you are using UTF-8 as your character set, you do not have to do anything special, just go ahead and send in UTF-8 data to the address fields, subject, keywords, filenames or body of the email and Action Mailer will auto encode it into quoted printable for you in the case of a header field or Base64 encode any body parts that are non US-ASCII.

For more complex examples such as defining alternate character sets or self encoding text first, please refer to the Mail library.
2.3 Complete List of Action Mailer Methods

There are just three methods that you need to send pretty much any email message:

    headers – Specifies any header on the email you want, you can pass a hash of header field names and value pairs, or you can call headers[:field_name] = ‘value’
    attachments – Allows you to add attachments to your email, for example attachments[‘file-name.jpg’] = File.read(‘file-name.jpg’)
    mail – Sends the actual email itself. You can pass in headers as a hash to the mail method as a parameter, mail will then create an email, either plain text, or multipart, depending on what email templates you have defined.
